For anyone interested is a nice visual comparison between qualitative and quantitative risk analysis approaches. This could be just the thing you're looking for.

I used ChatGPT to help me quickly write some code to compare quantitative and qualitative risk analysis methods.

I generated 5,000 random quantitative likelihoods (%) and impacts ($) and then mapped them to qualitative scales. Those qualitative values were then plotted onto a risk matrix.

I then also created a scale to translate those final quantitative risk values (likelihood x impact) into qualitative ratings and used that scale to shade the dots.

I thought it was an interesting way to see how noisy qualitative matrix-based risk ratings can be compared to calculating risk quantitatively. Every square on the matrix with more than one color represents an opportunity for sub-optimal decision making, based on the inherent errors in risk matrices.
